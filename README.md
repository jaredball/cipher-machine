This project implements a cipher-machine in C, allowing users to encrypt or decrypt codes, encode strings, and represent numbers in unary code. The program supports the following commands:

- encrypt: Encrypts user input based on Caesar's cipher.
- decrypt: Decrypts user input based on Caesar's cipher.
- unary: Encodes a number into a unary code.
- encode: Encodes user input in reverse order.
- exit: Exits the program.
