**Cipher-Machine**

**Overview:**

This C program offers functionalities for text encryption, decryption, unary number representation, and string encoding. Users can utilize the following commands to perform operations:

- **encrypt:** Encrypts user input based on Caesar's cipher.
- **decrypt:** Decrypts user input based on Caesar's cipher.
- **unary:** Encodes a number into a unary code.
- **encode:** Encodes user input in reverse order.
- **exit:** Exits the program.

**Usage:**

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a command from the provided list.
3. Follow the command format as specified.
4. Perform multiple commands within one session.
5. Use "exit" to terminate the program.

**Implementation Details:**

- **encrypt:** Shifts characters in the input string by 5 positions to encrypt the text.
- **decrypt:** Reverses the encryption process by shifting characters back by 5 positions.
- **unary:** Converts a non-negative integer input into unary code.
- **encode:** Reverses the order of characters in the input string.
